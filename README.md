#  Secure Authentication and Payment API 

##  Project Overview

This project is a secure backend API built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It implements user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token) and integrates Razorpay Payment Gateway for handling online payments securely.

The system allows users to register, login, access protected routes, create payment orders, and verify payments using cryptographic signature verification.

This project demonstrates real-world backend development practices including authentication, authorization, payment integration, and secure API design.

##  How to Run This Project Locally

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Gitanjali2809/auth-project.git
cd auth-project
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Step 3: Create .env file

Create a `.env` file in root folder and add:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/auth-project
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_key_secret
```

### Step 4: Start MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running locally.

### Step 5: Run the server

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
node server.js
```

Server will start at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

##  API Endpoints

### Authentication

Register user

```
POST /api/auth/register
```

Login user

```
POST /api/auth/login
```

Get user profile (Protected)

```
GET /api/auth/profile
```

---

### Payment
